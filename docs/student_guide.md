## Viewing Attendance

1. **Access Attendance Records**
   - Navigate to the "Attendance" section in your dashboard
   - Select a course from the dropdown menu
   - Your attendance records for that course will be displayed
   - If no records appear, your instructor may not have taken attendance yet

## Viewing Academic Marks

## Important Notes

For full functionality in the student account:

1. **Course Registration is Required**
   - You must register for courses through the "Register Course" section
   - Only after registering will you be able to see attendance and marks data
   - The available courses are those that instructors have offered

2. **Data Visibility**
   - Attendance and marks data becomes visible only after instructors record them
   - If you've registered for courses but see no data, instructors may not have posted it yet

## Troubleshooting

- If course dropdowns are empty, make sure you've registered for courses
- If after registering courses you still don't see your data, try logging out and back in
- Make sure instructors have started taking attendance and recording marks for your courses
- If you encounter any issues with selections not working, try refreshing the page
